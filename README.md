Rules for Participating Fighters:
        Rule 1: Click box to reveal fighter
        Rule 2: Click another box to match fighter
        Rule 3: If two boxes match, continue the fight (matching)
        Rule 4: If two boxes dont match, they will flip back & try again
        Rule 5: Continue matching until all boxes are matched
        Final Rule: Do not talk about Match Fighter
         (By the way... Don't forget your fight music below)
